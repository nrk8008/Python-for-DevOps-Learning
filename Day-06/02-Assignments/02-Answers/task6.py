#Task 6: Identity and Membership Operators
#Create a list my_list containing a few elements.
#Use identity operators (is and is not) to check if two variables are the same object.
#Use membership operators (in and not in) to check if an element is present in my_list.
#Print the results.

x= [1, 2, 3]
y = x
print( "x is y:", x is y)


a = "hello"

print("2 in my_list :", 2 in my_list)
print("2 not in my_list: ", 2 not in my_list)
